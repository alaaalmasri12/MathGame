3- Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation

4- You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.

5- Add a timer to track how long the user takes to finish the game.

6- Add a function that let's the user pick the number of questions.

7- Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations
