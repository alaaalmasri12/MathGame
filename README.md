# Requirements
1- You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
 The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
2- Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
3- You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
4- Add a timer to track how long the user takes to finish the game.
5- Add a function that let's the user pick the number of questions.
6- Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations
